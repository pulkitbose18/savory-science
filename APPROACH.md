# Approach to Building the Smart Recipe Generator

My approach focused on delivering a robust and user-friendly application by prioritizing core functionalities and maintainability.

Initially, the project included a machine learning component for image-based ingredient recognition. However, after careful consideration of the project's constraints, particularly the time limit and the goal of a "clean, production-quality" and easily deployable application, I recommended removing this feature. The existing ML implementation introduced significant complexity, increased bundle size, and presented challenges in achieving reliable ingredient mapping, which could detract from the overall user experience and project stability.

Instead, I concentrated on enhancing the core recipe generation and filtering capabilities. Key improvements include:

*   **Refined Ingredient Input:** Implemented a "Select from List" feature for ingredients, alongside manual text input, ensuring accurate ingredient validation.
*   **Stricter Recipe Matching:** Updated the recipe matching algorithm to use exact ingredient matches, improving the relevance of search results.
*   **Enhanced Filtering Options:** Added "Gluten-Free" and cooking time filters, providing users with more precise control over recipe discovery.
*   **Improved User Experience:** Integrated loading states for search operations and enhanced error handling for better user feedback.
*   **"Find Similar Recipes" Feature:** Developed a similarity-based recipe suggestion system, allowing users to discover new recipes based on their favorites.
*   **Clean Codebase:** Ensured the code is well-structured, readable, and adheres to best practices, facilitating future development and maintenance.

This streamlined approach ensures a highly functional, performant, and easily deployable application that effectively meets the project's primary objectives.
